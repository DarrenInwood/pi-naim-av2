# pi-naim-av2

Raspberry Pi integration with Naim AV2 preamp/DAC/processor.

*NOT WORKING YET*

Intention is to develop a daemon process that runs on a Raspberry Pi,
detecting a television's power/input selection/volume state on the HDMI-CEC
bus and syncing this with the Naim AV2 power/input selection/volume state.

Would also be nice to have it integrate with Moode or similar, running on
the same Pi, so the AV2 can be used as a high-quality network streamer.

Stretch goal, allow a Chromecast Audio plugged in to the AV2 to also be
detected and auto-power on/switch inputs/control volume.
